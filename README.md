# Operating Systems Project
FOS (Faculty of (Computer and Information Science) OS) is an educational OS for Ain Shams University Operating Systems Course CSW355, forked and refactored from MIT Operating Systems Lab 6.828 (http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-828-operating-system-engineering-fall-2012/).
It was created by Dr. Mahmoud Hossam and currently maintained by Dr. Ahmed Salah.
